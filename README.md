# Password-Generator
I've created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The code:
- Generates a password when the button is clicked
- Presents a series of prompts for password criteria
    * "Length of password"
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
(Code validates each input and at least one character type has to be selected. Once prompts are answered then the password is generated and displayed once the button is clicked)
